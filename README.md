# ADM Homework 4 (Group 20) - Recommendation systems and clustering everywhere

This is the repository Maintained by Group 20 for the Homework 4 of ADM. The primary goal of this homework is to leverage hashing and clustering techniques to extract meaningful insights and highlights from behavioral user data on Netflix, with a specific focus on UK movies. As part of the task, the team aims to implement robust methods for analyzing viewing habits, content popularity, and user demographics. By utilizing advanced data analysis techniques, the objective is to provide Netflix with valuable information that deepens the understanding of audience behavior within the United Kingdom, thereby enhancing the overall user experience on the streaming platform.

## Files in the Repository:
- `Main.ipynb` is the main file that contains all the answers to all the questions;
- In the **Command Line** folder there is the `.sh` file containg our solution and a screenshot with the result;

**Note**: For the bonus part , please consider using (if executing) [this](https://github.com/melipaolo/adm_hw4/blob/main/df_bonus_part.csv)  file. This is because the orginal dataset is too big and few shells like the clustering one can demand more than an hour for execution. Also to to review the notebook use the html file or [this](https://nbviewer.org/github/melipaolo/adm_hw4/blob/main/Main.ipynb) link, as some plots/outputs could not be visualized in the proper way by opening the .ipynb file inside jupyter.
